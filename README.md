# fizzbuzz-swift
A glorious repository of all the ways to fizzbuzz with Swift.

Fizz buzz has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.[2][3] Creating a list of the first 100 Fizz buzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability. FizzBuzz is also a popular Kata in the software craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen"[4] will use exercises, often similar to this one, called 'Kata'[5] repeatedly, often daily, in order to practice their craft, much like a soldier, a musician, a doctor or a dancer would repeat exercises or movements to practice theirs.[6] 


The requirements are:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
> of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
> five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and
> five print "FizzBuzz".

I'm looking For contributions to this project, to demonstrate various ways to fizzbuzz in this language. Here are the rules:
	* Name the file with "fizzbuzz"+"generaldescription".extention
	* Add a better description to the README.md below


* [fizzbuzz-ternary.swift](https://github.com/coston/fizzbuzz-swift/blob/master/fizzbuzz-ternary.swift)
  Straightforward solution using ternary
